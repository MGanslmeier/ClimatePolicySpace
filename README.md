# Empirical identification of feasible and strategic climate policies

> The political and institutional feasibility of implementing climate policy appears as a key impediment to accelerating climate action. Drawing on a rich dataset of climate policies introduced globally over the last 50 years, this paper explores global patterns in climate policy adoption to understand how climate policy feasibility is shaped by countries’ existing policies and institutional capacity. By constructing a ‘Climate Policy Space’ network based on the co-occurrence of climate policies across countries, we show that climate policy adoption is path-dependent, and therefore predictable: countries are significantly more likely to introduce policies that require similar institutional capacity and policy know-how to policies they have previously introduced. Exploiting this finding, we construct empirically validated ‘Climate Policy Feasibility Frontiers’ which, for a given country, identify policies that are (1) likely to be easiest to introduce; (2) have the greatest advantages in terms of capacity building and therefore facilitate further climate action; and (3) have the largest emissions reduction potential. As a complement to traditional cost-benefit analysis, such feasibility frontiers can inform more realistic and strategic climate policy prioritization across countries.*

## Replication

This repository includes all data and coding scripts that are used to estimate and replicate the figures and tables in the paper. The codes are written in Python, Stata, and R. The repository consists of two folders: one folder, called [1 climate possibility space](1 climate possibility space) the includes all relevant material to replicate the climate policy network; and one folder, called [results2 regressions - adoption and reduction potential](2 regressions - adoption and reduction potential), that includes all material to estimate the adoption regressions and emission reduction potential regressions.

If you have specific questions about the replication files, please do not hesitate to reach out.
